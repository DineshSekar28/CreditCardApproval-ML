## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Credit institutions need efficient and reliable ways to assess credit card applications. This project builds a predictive system using custom scoring logic, domain features, and AutoML to simulate approval decisions (`TARGET = 1`) or rejections (`TARGET = 0`).

---

## ðŸ§ª Initial Hypotheses

- Higher income and higher education positively affect approval chances.
- Owning property and having fewer dependents signals financial stability.
- Unusual employment patterns or housing types (e.g., office apartments) may indicate higher risk.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes demographic, financial, and employment-related attributes of credit card applicants.

| Feature               | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`    | Annual income                                   |
| `NAME_INCOME_TYPE`    | Income type (Working, State servant, etc.)       |
| `NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE` | Level of education                              |
| `NAME_HOUSING_TYPE`   | Housing status                                   |
| `DAYS_BIRTH`          | Days since birth (negative)                     |
| `DAYS_EMPLOYED`       | Days employed (negative; capped at 365243)      |
| `CNT_CHILDREN`        | Number of children                              |
| `CNT_FAM_MEMBERS`     | Family size                                     |
| `FLAG_OWN_CAR`        | Owns a car (Y/N)                                |
| `FLAG_OWN_REALTY`     | Owns real estate (Y/N)                          |
| `OCCUPATION_TYPE`     | Job type                                       |

---

## ðŸ”§ Data Preprocessing

- Converted `DAYS_BIRTH` and `DAYS_EMPLOYED` to `AGE` and `WORK_EXPERIENCE` (years)
- Replaced invalid employment durations (365243) with median of negative values
- Filled missing `OCCUPATION_TYPE` with "NA"
- Cleaned categorical values by removing special characters and normalizing spaces (for encoding compatibility)

---

## ðŸ§  Custom Credit Scoring

A rule-based scoring engine was developed using domain knowledge.

**Scoring Components:**

- **Income Score**: Buckets of 100K up to 500K (score capped at 5)
- **Education Score**: 0 to 4 scale (Lower secondary to Academic degree)
- **Income Type Score**: Highest for "State servant", lowest for "Student"
- **Housing Type Score**: Based on property ownership or stability
- **Family Size Score**: Score drops if family size > 4
- **Work Experience & Age Bracket Score**: Age and experience grouped into brackets
- **Asset Ownership**: Bonus points for car/realty owners

The final `CREDIT_SCORE` was computed by summing all component scores.

**Target Assignment:**
- Top 60% of scores labeled `TARGET = 1`
- Bottom 40% labeled `TARGET = 0`
- Minor noise introduced to simulate approval anomalies

---

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Income distribution skewed toward lower buckets (<200K)
- Majority of applicants fall between ages 25 and 60
- Pensioners showed inflated employment days (cleaned)
- Education and income positively correlated with approval
- Office apartment dwellers and large families show lower approval likelihood

---

## ðŸ“‰ Data Visualization (Tableau)

Interactive visualizations built with Tableau to explore key patterns:

- Approval breakdown by income bucket (side-by-side bar chart)
- Approval vs. Age/Work Experience (scatter & heatmaps)
- Education level and occupation type vs approval status
- Percent approval trends by housing and income type

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Workflow

- Setup done via **PyCaret**
- Ignored: `ID`, `CREDIT_SCORE`
- Enabled: Feature selection, multicollinearity removal
- Models trained: LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.
- Tuning: Used `tune_model()` to optimize hyperparameters (F1 Score)
- Final model: User-selected model (not necessarily AutoML winner)
- Evaluation: Predictions made on hold-out test set
